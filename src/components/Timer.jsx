Compete against another player in real-time. The first one to cross the finish line wins the race. Follow the race track carefully.
 If you go off the track, your car will fall, and youâ€™ll have to start over from the beginning. Precision is key!

 Tips:
1. Avoid sharp turns at high speeds to prevent losing control.
2. Stay focused and follow the track to avoid falling off.

    Controls:
    - Desktop: Use W, A, S, D for movement.
    - Mobile: Use the on-screen joystick for movement.
